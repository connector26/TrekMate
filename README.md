Hello All,
Myself Amey Choudhari.This is my third year graduation project in which the main problem statement which we picked up was as follows:

What happens in this busy life of events everyone wants that we should go somewhere out of all this life full of event keeping it behind and most of us like to visit mountains, especially exploring a mountain in deep finding some amazing spots having lots of fun and activites if one gets chance to but where to find the spots where we can go and relax ourselves.This is where "TrekMate" comes in picture we are a platform where the trek leads finds the enthusiastic people and excited people finds the adventure!.

So yeah, you can explore the trekmate as you can.

What i used:

Front-side-client-development-stack
php framework for backend
postgres sql as database
xampp for maintaing the track and to making sure that everything should be in a place


How to run project:
Step-1:

Download the project or clone the project using git.

Step-2:

Install vscode,postgres,xampp and php framework.(Can see tutorials too).

Step-3:

create a database having the necessary fields(refer trekmate.txt)

Step-4:

In connect.php replace the fields according to your machine.

Step-5:

Put the project in c:/xampp/htdocs

Step-6:

Open xampp start the apache server.

Step-7:

Go in your default browser and put the url as localhost and corresponding port.

Note:If only want to see the front-end run the sever and project by above method and comment connect.php wherever mentioned  in index.php and that is also not working comment the cursor in index.php
  

Thank you.
Amey Choudhari
